# Pi-Estimator
Simple Program that estimates the value of pi using the Monte Carlo method
I built this program using QT and so you will need to have QT on your machine to build and run it.
It is a simple alogrithm that has a vui with it. 
The gui allows a user to chose how many estimations the algorithm takes in order to estimate pi.
The gui also allows a user to see where each estimation landed and a plotted chart of the estimations.
